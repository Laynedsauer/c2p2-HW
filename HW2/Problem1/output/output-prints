##About Hist##
Accidentally used the .root file for problem 2, when I tried to use the other file, the calculation of the muon pair masses blew up giving errors. 
when I limited the number of muons, the graph looked similar with a similar peak.


Notes: the peak bin in the histogram is near 100GeV, I coudln't code in to find peak of histogram
